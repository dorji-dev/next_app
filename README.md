Implementation of everyday features with [NextJS App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs) with [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

## Run Locally

First run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install all the dependencies.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Noto_Sans, a custom Google Font.

To add extra components from **shadcn** run the command `npx shadcn-ui@latest add ${component_name}` or refer the [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) docs.

The repo and deployed site will be updated every time there is changes in NextJs features and version.
